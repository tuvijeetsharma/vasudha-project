            <h3>HOW TO INCREASE CROP YIELDS EFFECTIVELY</h3>
            <p>
                <i>. Crop yields are an essential aspect of every farmer’s day, impacting how
                    profitable their farmland can be. <br>. Learning how to improve crop yields is
                    key to successful farming, and access to new technologies and planting
                    methods has given farmers an opportunity increase crop production – the
                    key to maintaining the long term sustainability of their farm. <br>.
                    Corn crop yield rates have steadily increased over time, thanks to hardier corn hybrids
                    and smarter planting practices. <br>. Technologies that allow farmers to best understand their
                    soil, what kind of nutrients they may be lacking, and when to plant seeds have positively
                    affected outcomes. <br>. To put it simply, planting has benefitted from the introduction of science
                    and technology in farming.

            <h3>WHY ARE CROP YIELDS SO IMPORTANT FOR CROP PRODUCTION ?</h3>
            <i>
                <p>. The concept of high-performance agriculture is key in understanding the importance
                    of crop yields.<br>. How much you can produce within a given amount of land is essentially
                    how efficient you are as a farmer.<br>. In today’s economy, being able to do things
                    efficiently is as important as ever.<br>. You want to ensure that you are maximizing
                    your space and the land you have worked to cultivate.<br>. Crop yields not only determine
                    your efficiency, but your bottom-line as well.</p>

            <H3>PLANT THE SEEDS EARLY AND ON TIME</H3>
            <P><i>Choosing the right time to plant is often the most important part of planting.<br>.
                    The best strategy to use to increase yields is: if your soil is ready, start
                    planting.<br>. There are tests you can perform on your soil to see if it is ready
                    for planting.<br>. Today’s hybrid seeds create a more sustainable product, but
                    knowing if your field is ready for early planting is just as important.<br>. Planting
                    early can result in increased yields by taking advantage of unexpectedly early
                    favorable soil conditions.</P></i>

            <h3>HAVING GOOD QUALITY SEEDS</h3>
            <p><i>. Having quality seeds is the basis for increasing crop.<br>
                    . Whether you are looking into increasing your corn yields, or
                    maximizing your overall agricultural productivity, you need
                    to consider the strength of your seeds. Using hybrid seeds that are
                    naturally inclined to grow faster, stronger, and with greater efficiency
                    is pivotal to the success of your crops. Non-GMO seeds combine sustainability
                    and cost seamlessly, which accounts for both quality and cost.<br>.
                    Crop yields can be as complex as they are important for your farm.<br>.
                    Learning how to increase agricultural productivity is always on a farmer’s
                    mind, and there are multiple techniques to help improve your corn yields year
                    after year.<br>. These tips will provide you with a strong start so you are able to
                    begin putting them into practice, and start maximizing corn yields on your farm.

            <h3>
                Ensure Proper Water Drainage
            </h3>
            <p><i>
                    Water management is essential to crop survival and maximizing your corn’s yield potential
                    .<br>. It’s important to ensure your crop is getting enough water, but also that they aren’t
                    being over-watered.<br>. Developing a drainage system in your crops can help prevent waterlogging
                    and salinization in your soil, both of which can stifle growth and production.</i>
